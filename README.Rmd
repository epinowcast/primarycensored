## Summary

```{r, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
cat(gsub("\n[ ]+", " ", packageDescription("primarycensoreddist")$Description))
```

This package provides both R functions for working with censored distributions and Stan implementations for use in Bayesian modeling. It offers a flexible framework for handling various types of censoring in both R and Stan environments.

## Installation

<details><summary>Installing the package</summary>

```{r, child="vignettes/chunks/_readme-install-primarycensoreddist.Rmd"}
```

*Note: You can also use that last approach to install a specific commit if needed, e.g. if you want to try out a specific unreleased feature, but not the absolute latest developmental version.*

</details>

<details><summary>Installing CmdStan (optional for Stan functionality)</summary>

If you wish to use the Stan functions, you will need to install [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan), which also entails having a suitable C++ toolchain setup. We recommend using the [`cmdstanr` package](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). The Stan team provides instructions in the [_Getting started with
`cmdstanr`_](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) vignette, with other details and support at the [package site](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) along with some key instructions available in the [Stan resources package vignette](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/stan-help.html#toolchain), but the brief version is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# if you not yet installed `primarycensoreddist`, or you installed it without
# `Suggests` dependencies
install.packages(
  "cmdstanr",
  repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos"))
)
# once `cmdstanr` is installed:
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

*Note: You can speed up CmdStan installation using the `cores` argument. If you are installing a particular version of `epinowcast`, you may also need to install a past version of CmdStan, which you can do with the `version` argument.*

## Resources

We provide a range of other documentation, case studies, and community spaces to ask (and answer!) questions:

<details><summary>Package Website</summary>

The [`primarycensoreddist` website](https://primarycensoreddist.epinowcast.org/) includes a function reference, model outline, and case studies using the package. The site mainly concerns the release version, but you can also find documentation for [the latest development version](https://primarycensoreddist.epinowcast.org/dev/).

</details>

<details><summary>Vignettes</summary>

We have created [package vignettes](https://primarycensoreddist.epinowcast.org/articles) to help you get started with primarycensoreddist and to highlight other features with case studies.

</details>

<details><summary>Organisation Website</summary>

Our [organisation website](https://www.epinowcast.org/) includes links to other resources, [guest posts](https://www.epinowcast.org/blog.html), and [seminar schedule](https://www.epinowcast.org/seminars.html) for both upcoming and past recordings.

</details>

<details><summary>Community Forum</summary>

Our [community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/) has areas for [question and answer](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/interface/15) and [considering new methods and tools](https://community.epinowcast.org/c/projects/11), among others. If you are generally interested in real-time analysis of infectious disease, you may find this useful even if do not use `primarycensoreddist`.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and new contributors! We particularly appreciate help on [identifying and identified issues](https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensoreddist/issues). Please check and add to the issues, and/or add a [pull request](https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensoreddist/pulls) and see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/epinowcast/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

If you need a different underlying model for your work: `primarycensoreddist` provides a flexible framework for censored distributions in both R and Stan. If you implement new distributions or censoring mechanisms that expand the overall flexibility or improve the defaults, please let us know either here or on the [community forum](https://community.epinowcast.org/). We always like to hear about new use-cases and extensions to the package.

### How to make a bug report or feature request
