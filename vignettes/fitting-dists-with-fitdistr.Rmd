# Introduction

## What are we going to do in this Vignette

In this vignette, we'll demonstrate how to use `primarycensoreddist` in conjunction with `fitdistrplus` for fitting distributions. We'll cover the following key points:

1. Simulating censored delay distribution data
2. Fitting a naive model using `fitdistrplus`
3. Evaluating the naive model's performance
4. Fitting an improved model using `primarycensoreddist` functionality
5. Comparing the `primarycensoreddist` model's performance to the naive model

## What might I need to know before starting

This vignette assumes some familiarity with the `fitdistrplus` package. If you are not familiar with it then you might want to start with the [Introduction to `fitdistrplus`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/vignettes/fitdistrplus_vignette.html) vignette.

## Packages used in this vignette

Alongside the `primarycensoreddist` package we will use the `fitdistrplus` package for fitting distributions. We will also use the `ggplot2` package for plotting and `dplyr` for data manipulation.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(primarycensoreddist)
library(fitdistrplus)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# Simulating censored and truncated delay distribution data

We'll start by simulating some censored and truncated delay distribution data. We'll use the `rprimarycensoreddist` function (actually we will use the `rpcens ` alias for brevity).

```{r sample-lognormal}
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility

# Define the true distribution parameters
n <- 1000
shape <- 1.77 # This gives a mean of 4 and sd of 3 for a gamma distribution
rate <- 0.44

# Generate fixed pwindow, swindow, and obs_time
pwindows <- rep(1, n)
swindows <- rep(1, n)
obs_times <- rep(8, n) # Truncation at 8

# Function to generate a single sample
generate_sample <- function(pwindow, swindow, obs_time) {
  rpcens(
    1, rgamma,
    shape = shape, rate = rate,
    pwindow = pwindow, swindow = swindow, D = obs_time
  )
}

# Generate samples
samples <- mapply(generate_sample, pwindows, swindows, obs_times)

# Create initial data frame
delay_data <- data.frame(
  pwindow = pwindows,
  swindow = swindows,
  obs_time = obs_times,
  observed_delay = samples,
  observed_delay_upper = samples + swindows
)

head(delay_data)

# Compare the samples with and without secondary censoring to the true
# distribution
# Calculate empirical CDF
empirical_cdf <- ecdf(samples)

# Create a sequence of x values for the theoretical CDF
x_seq <- seq(0, 8, length.out = 100)

# Calculate theoretical CDF
theoretical_cdf <- pgamma(x_seq, shape = shape, rate = rate)

# Create a long format data frame for plotting
cdf_data <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x_seq, 2),
  probability = c(empirical_cdf(x_seq), theoretical_cdf),
  type = rep(c("Observed", "Theoretical"), each = length(x_seq)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Plot
ggplot(cdf_data, aes(x = x, y = probability, color = type)) +
  geom_step(linewidth = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(Observed = "#4292C6", Theoretical = "#252525")
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = mean(samples), color = "Observed"),
    linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = shape / rate, color = "Theoretical"),
    linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Observed vs Theoretical CDF",
    x = "Delay",
    y = "Cumulative Probability",
    color = "CDF Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 8)) # Set x-axis limit to match truncation
```

# Fitting a naive model using `fitdistr`

We first fit a naive model using the `fitdistcens()` function. This function is designed to handle secondary censored data but does not handle primary censoring or truncation without extension.

```{r fit-naive-model}
fit <- delay_data |>
  dplyr::select(left = observed_delay, right = observed_delay_upper) |>
  fitdistcens(
    distr = "gamma",
    start = list(shape = 1, rate = 1)
  )

summary(fit)
```

We see that the naive model has fit poorly due to the primary censoring and right truncation in the data.

# Fitting an improved model using `primarycensoreddist`

We'll now fit an improved model using the `primarycensoreddist` package. To do this we need to define the custom distribution functions using the `primarycensoreddist` package that are required by `fitdistrplus`. Rather than using `fitdistcens` we use `fitdist` because our functions are handling the censoring themselves.

```{r fit-improved-model}
# Define custom distribution functions using primarycensoreddist
# The try catch is required by fitdistrplus
dpcens_gamma <- function(x, shape, rate) {
  result <- tryCatch(
    {
      dprimarycensoreddist(
        x, pgamma,
        shape = shape, rate = rate,
        pwindow = 1, swindow = 1, D = 8
      )
    },
    error = function(e) {
      rep(NaN, length(x))
    }
  )
  return(result)
}

ppcens_gamma <- function(q, shape, rate) {
  result <- tryCatch(
    {
      pprimarycensoreddist(
        q, pgamma,
        shape = shape, rate = rate,
        pwindow = 1, D = 8
      )
    },
    error = function(e) {
      rep(NaN, length(q))
    }
  )
  return(result)
}

# Fit the model using fitdistcens with custom gamma distribution
pcens_fit <- samples |>
  fitdist(
    distr = "pcens_gamma",
    start = list(shape = 1, rate = 1)
  )

summary(pcens_fit)
```

We see very good agreement between the true and estimated parameters.

**Note** that this approach is suboptimal as it prevents using from being able to specify our data using the `fitdistcens` `left` and `right` formulation. This in turns means that though both `primarycensoreddist` and `fitdistrplus` support mixed secondary censoring intervals as implemented here we are restricted to enforcing all individual secondary censoring intervals to be the same. If this functionality is of interest then please open an issue on the `primarycensoreddist` GitHub page.
