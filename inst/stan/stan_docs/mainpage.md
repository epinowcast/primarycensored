# Primary Censored Stan Functions

The primarycensored R package aims to address common challenges in estimating delay distributions. It does this by providing tools to manipulate primary censored delay distributions in Stan and R.

This documentation covers the Stan functions. All the Stan functions have a corresponding R function, which can be found in the [primarycensored R Reference](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/dev/reference/index.html).

## Documentation Structure

Each function page includes:
- A brief description of the function's purpose
- Detailed explanation of the function's behavior
- Parameter descriptions with standardized documentation
- Return value information
- Example usage where applicable
