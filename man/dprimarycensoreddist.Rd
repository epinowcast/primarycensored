\title{Compute the primary event censored PMF for delays}
\usage{
dprimarycensoreddist(
  x,
  pdist,
  pwindow = 1,
  swindow = 1,
  D = Inf,
  dprimary = stats::dunif,
  dprimary_args = list(),
  log = FALSE,
  ...
)

dpcens(
  x,
  pdist,
  pwindow = 1,
  swindow = 1,
  D = Inf,
  dprimary = stats::dunif,
  dprimary_args = list(),
  log = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of quantiles}

\item{pdist}{Distribution function (CDF)}

\item{pwindow}{Primary event window}

\item{swindow}{Secondary event window (default: 1)}

\item{D}{Maximum delay (truncation point). If finite, the distribution is
truncated at D. If set to Inf, no truncation is applied. Defaults to Inf.}

\item{dprimary}{Function to generate the probability density function
(PDF) of primary event times. This function should take a value \code{x} and a
\code{pwindow} parameter, and return a probability density. It should be
normalized to integrate to 1 over [0, pwindow]. Defaults to a uniform
distribution over [0, pwindow]. Users can provide custom functions or use
helper functions like \code{dexpgrowth} for an exponential growth distribution.
See \code{primary_dists.R} for examples.}

\item{dprimary_args}{List of additional arguments to be passed to
dprimary. For example, when using \code{dexpgrowth}, you would
pass \code{list(min = 0, max = pwindow, r = 0.2)} to set the minimum, maximum,
and rate parameters.}

\item{log}{Logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the distribution function}
}
\value{
Vector of primary event censored PMFs, normalized by D if finite
(truncation adjustment)
}
\description{
This function computes the primary event censored probability mass function
(PMF) for a given set of quantiles. It adjusts the PMF of the primary event
distribution by accounting for the delay distribution and potential
truncation at a maximum delay (D). The function allows for custom primary
event distributions and delay distributions.
}
\details{
The primary event censored PMF is computed by taking the difference of the
primary event censored cumulative distribution function (CDF) at two points,
\eqn{d + \text{swindow}} and \eqn{d}. The primary event censored PMF,
\eqn{f_{\text{cens}}(d)}, is given by:
\deqn{
f_{\text{cens}}(d) = F_{\text{cens}}(d + \text{swindow}) - F_{\text{cens}}(d)
}
where \eqn{F_{\text{cens}}} is the primary event censored CDF. For the
explanation and mathematical details of the CDF, refer to the documentation
of \code{\link[=pprimarycensoreddist]{pprimarycensoreddist()}}.
