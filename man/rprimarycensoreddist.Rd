\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of random samples to generate.}

\item{rdist}{Function to generate random samples from the delay distribution
for example \code{\link[stats:Lognormal]{stats::rlnorm()}} for lognormal distribution.}

\item{pwindow}{Primary event window}

\item{D}{Maximum delay (truncation point). If finite, the distribution is
truncated at D. If set to Inf, no truncation is applied. Defaults to Inf.}

distribution (default is \code{\link[stats:Uniform]{stats::runif()}}).}

samples to account for truncation (default is 1.2).}

distribution

\description{
This function generates random samples from a primary event censored
distribution. It adjusts the distribution by accounting for the primary
event distribution and potential truncation at a maximum delay (D). The
function allows for custom primary event distributions and delay
distributions.
}
\details{
The primary event censored random samples are generated by first
oversampling to account for potential truncation. Primary event times are
generated from the specified primary event distribution, and delays are
generated from the specified delay distribution. The total delays are
calculated by adding the primary event times and the delays. These total
delays are then rounded to the nearest secondary event window (swindow).
Truncation is applied to ensure that the delays are within the specified
range [0, D]. If the number of valid samples is less than the desired
number of samples (n), additional samples are generated until the required
number of valid samples is obtained.
