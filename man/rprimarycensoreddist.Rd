\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of random samples to generate.}

\item{rdist}{Function to generate random samples from the delay distribution
for example \code{\link[stats:Lognormal]{stats::rlnorm()}} for lognormal distribution.}

(default is 1). If \code{swindow = 0} then no rounding is applied.}

\item{D}{Maximum delay (truncation point). If finite, the distribution is
truncated at D. If set to Inf, no truncation is applied. Defaults to Inf.}

distribution censored by the secondary event window.

\description{
This function generates random samples from a primary event censored
distribution. It adjusts the distribution by accounting for the primary
event distribution and potential truncation at a maximum delay (D). The
function allows for custom primary event distributions and delay
distributions.
}
\details{
The mathematical formulation for generating random samples from a primary
event censored distribution is as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Generate primary event times (p) from the specified primary event
distribution (f_p) within the primary event window (pwindow):
\deqn{p \sim f_p(x), \quad 0 \leq x \leq pwindow}
\item Generate delays (d) from the specified delay distribution (f_d) with
parameters theta:
\deqn{d \sim f_d(x; \theta)}
\item Calculate the total delays (t) by adding the primary event times and
the delays:
\deqn{t = p + d}
\item Apply truncation to ensure that the delays are within the specified
range [0, D]:
\deqn{t_{truncated} = \{t \mid 0 \leq t < D\}}
\item Round the truncated delays to the nearest secondary event window
(swindow):
\deqn{t_{valid} = \lfloor \frac{t_{truncated}}{swindow} \rfloor
     \times swindow}
}

The function oversamples to account for potential truncation and generates
additional samples if needed to reach the desired number of valid samples.
