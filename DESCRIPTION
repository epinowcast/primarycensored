Description: This package provides both R functions for working with primary
    event censored distributions and Stan implementations for use in Bayesian
    modeling. Primary event censored distributions are useful for modeling
    delayed reporting scenarios in epidemiology and other fields. It provides
    support for arbitrary delay distributions, a range of common primary
    distributions, and allows for truncation and secondary event censoring
    to be accounted for.
