Description: Provides functions for working with primary
    event censored distributions and 'Stan' implementations for use in Bayesian
    modeling. Primary event censored distributions are useful for modeling
    delayed reporting scenarios in epidemiology and other fields (Charniga et
    al. (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.08841>). It also provides support for
    arbitrary delay distributions, a range of common primary distributions, and
    allows for truncation and secondary event censoring to be accounted for
    (Park et al. (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247>). A subset of
    common distributions also have analytical solutions implemented, allowing
    for faster computation. In addition, it provides multiple methods for
    fitting primary event censored distributions to data via optional
    dependencies.
