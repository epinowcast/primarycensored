#' Generate random samples from a primary event censored distribution
#'
#' This function generates random samples from a primary event censored
#' distribution. It adjusts the distribution by accounting for the primary
#' event distribution and potential truncation at a maximum delay (D). The
#' function allows for custom primary event distributions and delay
#' distributions.
#'
#' @inheritParams dprimarycensoreddist
#'
#' @param rdist Function to generate random samples from the delay distribution
#' for example [stats::rlnorm()] for lognormal distribution.
#'
#' @param swindow Integer specifying the window size for rounding the delay
#' (default is 1). If `swindow = 0` then no rounding is applied.
#'
#' @param n Number of random samples to generate.
#'
#' @param rprimary Function to generate random samples from the primary
#' distribution (default is [stats::runif()]).
#'
#' @param rprimary_args List of additional arguments to be passed to rprimary.
#'
#' @param oversampling_factor Factor by which to oversample the number of
#' samples to account for truncation (default is 1.2).
#'
#' @param ... Additional arguments to be passed to the distribution function.
#'
#' @return Vector of random samples from the primary event censored
#' distribution censored by the secondary event window.

#' @details
#' The primary event censored random samples are generated by first
#' oversampling to account for potential truncation. Primary event times are
#' generated from the specified primary event distribution, and delays are
#' generated from the specified delay distribution. The total delays are
#' calculated by adding the primary event times and the delays. These total
#' delays are then rounded to the nearest secondary event window (swindow).
#' Truncation is applied to ensure that the delays are within the specified
#' range \[0, D\]. If the number of valid samples is less than the desired
#' number of samples (n), additional samples are generated until the required
#' number of valid samples is obtained.
