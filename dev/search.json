Accurately estimating calculating distributions essential understanding underlying processes making informed decisions[1]. However, estimating distributions can challenging due various factors, including censoring truncation observed data[2]. estimation delay distributions often faces following challenges: Primary event censoring: primary event (e.g., exposure pathogen start process) often observed degree interval censoring. means exact time event known, rather, known occurred within certain time interval, commonly day. result, distribution based primary events combination underlying true distribution censoring distribution. Truncation: observation delay distributions often conditioned occurrence secondary event. leads truncation observed distribution, delays longer observation time captured data. Consequently, observed distribution combination underlying true distribution, censoring distribution, observation time. Secondary event censoring: secondary event (e.g., symptom onset end process) also frequently observed interval censoring. additional layer censoring complicates estimation delay distribution. primarycensoreddist package aims address challenges providing tools manipulate primary censored delay distributions. accounting censoring truncation present data, package enables accurate estimation use underlying true distribution. vignette, provide quick introduction main functions concepts primarycensoreddist package. cover mathematical formulation problem, demonstrate usage key functions, provide signposting learn .","code":""},{"path":"https://primarycensoreddist.epinowcast.org/dev/articles/primarycensoreddist.html","id":"packages-in-this-getting-started-vignette-","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Packages in this getting started vignette.","title":"Getting Started with primarycensoreddist","text":"well primarycensoreddist package vignette also uses ggplot2.","code":"# Load packages library(primarycensoreddist) library(ggplot2) # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(123)"},{"path":"https://primarycensoreddist.epinowcast.org/dev/articles/primarycensoreddist.html","id":"generating-random-samples-with-rprimarycensoreddist","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Generating Random Samples with rprimarycensoreddist()","title":"Getting Started with primarycensoreddist","text":"function generates random samples primary event censored distribution. adjusts distribution accounting primary event distribution, potential truncation maximum delay (D), secondary event censoring. mathematical formulation generating random samples primary event censored distribution follows: Generate primary event times (\\(p\\)) specified primary event distribution (\\(f_p\\)) within primary event window (\\(pwindow\\)): \\[p \\sim f_p(x), \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq pwindow\\] Generate delays (\\(d\\)) specified delay distribution (\\(f_d\\)) parameters \\(\\theta\\): \\[d \\sim f_d(x; \\theta)\\] Calculate total delays (\\(t\\)) adding primary event times delays: \\[t = p + d\\] Round total delays nearest secondary event window (\\(swindow\\)): \\[t_{rounded} = \\lfloor \\frac{t}{swindow} \\rfloor \\times swindow\\] Apply truncation ensure delays within specified range \\([0, D]\\): \\[t_{valid} = \\{t_{rounded} \\mid 0 \\leq t_{rounded} < D\\}\\] ’s example use rprimarycensoreddist() sample log-normal distribution without secondary interval censoring. simplicity use daily secondary censoring window events.
